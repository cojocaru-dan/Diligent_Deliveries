# Codecool Diligent Deliveries
### Creating simple model classes in C#. 

### In this project we are going to model the daily routine of a deliverer at a company.
### The riders are allocated a bunch of addresses each morning, and they try to deliver the packages during the day. The company has a bonus policy for riders: those who are able to deliver most out of their allocated packages receive a bonus for the day. If there is a tie, each one should get the bonus.

### We create an application that tracks the riders' performance to find out who to reward at the end of the day. Every delivery has a random chance for success, but no less than 50%. When there's a failed delivery, the rider can choose to attempt it again depending on his strategy. 

### We covered concepts like: public/private members, immutability, method overriding, readability.
